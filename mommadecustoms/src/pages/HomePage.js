                        I always loved creating shirts, back in high school I use to airbrush and hand paint characters on shirts for classmates. Fast Forward to 7 years later I meet my husband and mother in law who had a t-shirt screen print shop. My husband later wasn't able to maintain the shop because of his full time job and balancing family life. After 3-4 years of the equipment sitting and collecting dust a lightbulb went off in my head "that I could do this, THIS IS MEANT TO BE." I got into the shop and after a while of trial and error, a little quick training from husband here I am and I'm out here killing it!

                        This is something I really take pride in. A lot of tears and sweat in the beginning learning the screen press, and with my families support I was able to branch out into other shirt printing machines. Thankful for the late nights and the family babysitting while I am able to put my all into this. Every shirt is made with care, passion, and love they are MOM MADE!
                        
                        I also SCREENPRINT for businesses, events, school functions, family reunions, etc. If you would like to buy in bulk I do have special rates, just send me a message.

                        CHECK OUT ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES, I provide videos of shirts sometimes pictures do not do them any justice you canâ€™t always see how they sparkle.
