Problem/Scenario: My older sister, Lauren, makes custom printed apparel. She has contracted someone to build her a web application. While it is 80-90 % complete, I would like to take the knowledge I have gained and apply myself to make my own version of her online retail web application.

Purpose: To create an interactive and smooth functioning website for my sister's clients/consumer to use and have access to her entire inventory.

Likely Users: Fashionistas, Kids, Parents, Sports Teams, Professional Athletes, Teens, Adults, Elderly
